New fields may be introduced in later versions of the field guide. Therefore
consuming applications should tolerate the addition of new fields with ease.

The ordering of fields in objects is undefined. The fields may appear in any order
and consuming applications should not rely on any specific ordering. It is safe to consider a nulled field 
and the absence of a field as the same thing.

Not all fields appear in all contexts. For example response with error messages
may not contain fields for data, dimensions and attributes.

## <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
Let's first start with a brief introduction of the SDMX information model.

In order to make sense of some statistical data, we need to know the concepts 
associated with them. For example, on its own the figure 1.2953 is pretty meaningless, 
but if we know that this is an exchange rate for the US dollar against the euro on 
23 November 2006, it starts making more sense. 

There are two types of concepts: dimensions and attributes. Dimensions, when combined, 
allow to uniquely identify statistical data. Attributes on the other hand do not help 
identifying statistical data, but they add useful information (like the unit of measure 
or the number of decimals). 

The measurement of some phenomenon (e.g. the figure 1.2953 mentioned above) is known as an
"observation" in SDMX. Observations are grouped together into a "data set". However, there
can also be an intermediate grouping. For example, all exchange rates for the US dollar 
against the euro can be measured on a daily basis and these measures can then be
grouped together, in a so-called "time series". Similarily, you can group a collection of 
observations made at the same point in time, in a "cross-section" (for example, 
the values of the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc against the euro at a
particular date). Of course, these intermediate groupings are entirely optional and you
may simply decide to have a flat list of observations in your data set.

The SDMX information model is much richer than this limited introduction, 
however the above should be sufficient to understand the JSON format proposed here. For
additional information, please refer to the [SDMX documentation](http://sdmx.org/?page_id=10).

## <a name="Message"></a>Message

Message is the response you get back from the RESTful API. Message is the top
level object and it contains the data as well as the metadata needed to interpret those data. 
Example:

    {
      "sdmx-proto-json": "2012-11-15",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "BIS Effective Exchange Rates",
        "id": "b1804c51-1ee3-45a9-bb75-795cd4e06489",
        "prepared": "2012-05-04T03:30:00",
        "structure": {
            # structure objects #
        }
      },
      "dataSets": [
        # data set objects #
      ],
      "errors": null
    }

### sdmx-proto-json

*String*. A string that specifies the version of the SDMX-PROTO-JSON response. A list of valid versions will
be released later on. Example:

    "sdmx-proto-json": "2012-11-15"

### Header

*Object* *nullable*. *Header* contains basic information about the message.
Example:

    "header": {
      "name": "BIS Effective Exchange Rates",
      "id": "b1804c51-1ee3-45a9-bb75-795cd4e06489",
      "prepared": "2012-05-04T03:30:00",
      "structure": {
        # structure objects #
      }
    },


### dataSets

*Array* *nullable*. *DataSets* field is an array of *[DataSet](#DataSet)* objects. In typical cases, the file will
contain only one data set. However, in some cases, such as when retrieveing, from an SDMX 2.1 web service, what has
changed in the data source since in particular point in time, the web service might return more than one data set. 
Example:

    "dataSets": [
      {
        "dataSetAction": "Informational",
        "extracted": "2012-05-04T03:30:00",
        "data": [
          # data object #
        ]
      }    
    ]

### errors

*Array* *nullable*. RESTful web services indicates errors using the HTTP status
codes. In addition, whenever appropriate, the error can also be returned using
the error fields. Error is an array of error messages. If there are no errors
then error is null. Example:

    "errors": [
      "Invalid number of dimensions in parameter key"
    ]

###### parent

*String* *nullable*. Parent value (for code hierarchies). If parent is null then
the value does not belong to any hierarchy. Hierarchy root values have special
value "ROOT" for the parent. There may be multiple roots. Each value has only one
parent. Example:

    "parent": "U2"

###### start

*String* *nullable*. Start date for the period in a time dimension.
This field is useful only when the value represents a period for a time dimension
(dimension type is 'time'). Value is a date in ISO format for the beginning of the
period. Example:

    "start": "2007-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"

###### end

        "seriesDimensions": ["CURRENCY"],
        "observationDimensions": ["TIME_PERIOD"],
        "dataSetAttributes": [],
        "seriesAttributes": ["TITLE"],
        "observationAttributes": ["OBS_STATUS"]
    }

## <a name="DataSets"></a>DataSets

DataSets object is an array of *[DataSet](#DataSet)* objects. It also contains additional metadata. Example:

    "dataSets": [
      {
        "dataSetAction": "Informational",
        "extracted": "2012-05-04T03:30:00",
        "data": [
          # data object #
        ]
      }    
    ]
    
### dataSetID

*String* *nullable*. DataSetID provides an identifier for the data set.
Example:

    "dataSetID": "ECB_EXR_2011-06-17"

### dataSetAction

*String* *nullable*. DataSetAction provides a list of actions, describing the intention of the data transmission 
from the sender's side. ```Default value is Informational```

* Append - this is an incremental update for an existing data set or the provision of new data or documentation 
(attribute values) formerly absent. If any of the supplied data or metadata is already present, it will not replace
that data.

* Replace - data are to be replaced, and may also include additional data to be appended. 

* Delete - data are to be deleted. 

* Informational - data are being exchanged for informational purposes only, and not meant to update a system.

Example:

    "dataSetAction": "Informational"
    
### provider    

*Object* *nullable*. Provider is information about the party that provides the data contained in the dataset.
Provider contains the following fields:

* id - *string*. The id attribute holds the identification of the party.
* name - *string* *nullable*. Name is a human-readable name of the party.

Example:

    "provider": {
      "id": "EUROSTAT"
    }    

### reportingBegin

*String* *nullable*. ReportingBegin provides the start of the time period covered by the message. Example:

    "reportingBegin": "2012-05-04"

### reportingEnd

*String* *nullable*. ReportingEnd provides the end of the time period covered by the message. Example:

    "reportingEnd": "2012-06-01"    

### validFrom

*String* *nullable*. The validFromDate indicates the inclusive start time indicating the validity of the information in the data.

    "validFrom": "2012-01-01T10:00:00Z"

### validTo

*String* *nullable*. The validToDate indicates the inclusive end time indicating the validity of the information in the data.

    "validTo": "2013-01-01T10:00:00Z"

### publicationYear

*String* *nullable*. The publicationYear holds the ISO 8601 four-digit year.

    "publicationYear": "2005"

### publicationPeriod

*String* *nullable*. The publicationPeriod specifies the period of publication of the data in terms of whatever 
provisioning agreements might be in force (i.e., "2005-Q1" if that is the time of publication for a data set 
published on a quarterly basis).

    "publicationPeriod": "2005-Q1"
    
### dimensions

*Array* *nullable*. Collection of dimensions values attached to the data set level. This is typically the case when a 
particular dimension always has the same value for the data available in the data message. In order to avoid repetition, 
that value can simply be attached at the data set level. Example:

    "dimensions": [0]    
    
For information on how to handle the dimension values, see the section dedicate to [handling component values](#handling_values)    
    
### attributes

*Array* *nullable*. Collection of attributes values attached to the data set level. This is typically the case when a 
particular attribute always has the same value for the data available in the data message. In order to avoid repetition, 
that value can simply be attached at the data set level. Example:

    "attributes": [0]
    
For information on how to handle the attribute values, see the section dedicate to [handling component values](#handling_values)        

### Data

Data object contains the observation values and associated metadata (dimensions and attrbutes). 

Data can be represented as a flat list of observations or can be grouped into collections (slices) that can be either
time series or cross-sections.

When data are grouped into collections, data object contains three fields: dimensions, attributes and observations. 
Example:

    {
      "dimensions": [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
      "attributes": [ 0, 1 ],
      "observations": [
        [ 0, 105.6, null, null ],
        [ 1, 105.9 ],
        [ 2, 106.9 ],
        [ 3, 107.3, 0 ]
      ]
    }

In this case, data objects map directly to series in SDMX-ML messages (series, in SDMX 2.1, is a generic term that 
covers both time series and cross-sections). Series have both dimensions and observations fields. Attributes
field is optional in case there are no attributes at the series level. The array values in the dimensions field 
are always integers (null is not possible).

#### dimensions

*Array* *nullable*. An array of dimension values. Each value is an index to the
*values* array in the respective *Dimension* object. 

    // Dimensions for series
    "dimensions": [
      0,
      93,
      12,
      1
    ]
    
For information on how to handle the dimension values, see the section dedicate to [handling component values](#handling_values).    

#### attributes

*Array* *nullable*. Collection of attributes values. Each value is an index to the
*values* array in the respective *Attribute* object. Example:

    "attributes": [ 0, 1 ]
    
For information on how to handle the attribute values, see the section dedicate to [handling component values](#handling_values).    

#### observations

*Array* *nullable*. An array of observation values. Each observation value is an
array of two of more values.

    {
      "dimensions": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
      "observations": [
        [ 0, 86.7 ],
        [ 1, 86.9 ],
    },
    {
      "dimensions": [ 0, 0, 1 ],
      "observations": [
        [ 0, 87.2 ],
        [ 1, null, 0 ]
      ]
    }

First element in an observation value array is index value of the observation level dimension. 
Second element is the observation value. The data type for observation value is *Number*. Data type for a reported
missing observation value is a *null*.

Elements after the observation value are values for the observation level attributes.

----

## <a name="handling_values">Handling component values</a>

Component values map to the values in the component objects. The array index maps to the array index in the appropriate
property of the packaging field. 

Let's say for example that the following message needs to be processed:

There is only one data set in the message, and it contains two series.

    {
        "dimensions": [0],
        "attributes": [0],                       
        "observations": [
            [0, 1.5931, 0],
            [1, 1.5925, 0]
        ]
    }, 
    {
        "dimensions": [1],
        "attributes": [1],
        "observations": [
            [0, 40.3426, 0],
            [1, 40.3000, 0]
        ]
    }
    
The packaging field tells us that, out of the 6 dimensions, 4 have the same value for the 2 series and are therefore 
attached to the data set level:

    "packaging": {
        "dataSetDimensions": ["FREQ", "CURRENCY_DENOM", "EXR_TYPE", "EXR_SUFFIX"],
        "seriesDimensions": ["CURRENCY"],
        "observationDimensions": ["TIME_PERIOD"],
        "dataSetAttributes": [],
        "seriesAttributes": ["TITLE"],
        "observationAttributes": ["OBS_STATUS"]
    }

We see that, for the first series, we get the value 0:

    "dimensions": [0]
    
From the packaging information, we know that the identifier of the dimension for this series is CURRENCY.

    "seriesDimensions": ["CURRENCY"]
    
We can now find the CURRENCY component in the collection of components available below the structure field available in the
metadata object:

    "CURRENCY": {
        "id": "CURRENCY",
        "name": "Currency",
        "values": [
            {
                "id": "NZD",
                "name": "New Zealand dollar"
            }, 
            {
                "id": "RUB",
                "name": "Russian rouble"
            }
        ]
    }
    
The value 0 identified previously is the index of the item in the collection of values for this component. In this case,
the dimension value is therefore "New Zealand dollar".

The same logic applies when mapping attributes.
